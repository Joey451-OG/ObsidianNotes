**Professor**: Dr. Jurss

Attendance: 
Very light. You can miss up to eight classes before getting any direct consequences. After each after your grade is reduced by a letter grade.
You have until 10:10 am before the attendance scanners count you as absent.

Textbook material should be available as an ebook. Online homework is also online.

OWLV2 is our homework system. (kinda like Person from Calc ig)

4, 1 hour exams. Frequent exams is common in Chem. These exams are about every 3/4 weeks. **Don't fall behind here**. 

Final exam on top (so fifth): Final exam will replace your lowest grade in the class. Just like Comp Sci. 

Review Sessions: 

Abby:
Mon 4-5:30p Lamar 129
Wed - 4:45 - 6:15p Bishop 107

Trey:
T, TH 5:30 - 7:00p Bishop 107

General Chem help desk: DUFF 404 M - TH 9a - 4p

Office Hours : M 2p - 3p, W 3:30p - 4:30p

Really  look at the ebook and online homework system. Lots of stuff in there.

Scantrons: 
We use scantrons during the test. We need the purple Scan trons. If you bring 5 scan trons to a test, you get bonus points.

Every question on the homework as 10 attempts. Homework is 20% of your grade so ace this. 

We may need the TI-84 for this class.

(says computer isn't allowed in the sylabus may need a physical notebook)

Diferent types of information:
a) Factual Information (What)
	- Periodic table/trends
	- Nomenclature
	- Definition of phenomena
b) Procedural Information (How)
	- Chem 115 lab
	- Data processing
c) Conceptual Information (Why)
- Data interpretation

Grade:
19% homework
59% exams (~%15/exam)
22% final

85 - 100% | 574 - 675 points | A 
70 - 84% | 473 - 573 points | B
55 - 69 % | 371 - 572 points | C

You get 2 hours for the final exam. It is cumlitave for the entire course.

Every odd number question has an answer in the textbook. Lots of practice in OWL. 


# **Chapter 1:**

Have a physical notebook to work out the problems in chem. 

**Chemistry** $\rightarrow$ The study of matter.

**Matter** $\rightarrow$ Any that occupies space and has mass

**Mass** $\rightarrow$ Measure of the amount of matter that an object contains

> All know substances in our universe are composed of 94 naturally occurring atoms.

**Atom** $\rightarrow$ Smallest distinguishable particle (for this class at least)

Scientific Method:
1. Make an observation
2. Form a hypothesis
	1. A good hypothesis is *falsifiable*
	2. The results of an experiment may support a hypothesis or prove it wrong
3. Conduct experiments

**Law** $\rightarrow$ A concise verbal o mathematical statement that describes an observable occurrence that is always true under any conditions.

Laws allow use to predict future observations.

**Theory** $\rightarrow$ A well-tested, unifying principle that explains a body of facts.
- Theories can suggest new hypotheses that can be tested experimentally.

Classifications of Matter:
- State (solid, liquid, gas, plasma)
	-  In *solid matter* the atoms or molecules pack close to each other. It has a fixed volume and a fixed shape.
	- In *liquid matter* the molecules pack about as closely as the do in solid matter but they are free to more relative to each other (fixed volume, not fixed shape)
	- In *gaseous matter* they have an infinite shape and volume.
- Composition (element, compound, mixture)
	- Pure substance or a mixture
	- Pure substances can't be broken down in normal circumstances.
	- Compounds are substances composed of two or more elements in fixed definite proportions. A compound can be broken down into its' components. 

Inter-molecular forces help us understand these classifications. 

Familiarize yourself with the periodic table!

**Temperature Conversions**

$$K = \degree C \ + \ 273.15$$
$$\degree C = \frac{(\degree F - 32)}{1.8}$$
$$\degree F = (1.8)\degree C + 32$$
**Mass Length and Volume**

Remember:
- $1kg = 1000g$
- $1g  = 1000mg$

$1\ cm^3 = 1\ ml = 0.001\ L$

**Energy Units**
![[Pasted image 20240830101418.png]]

**Reliability of Measurements**
- *Accuracy* refers to how close the measured value is to the actual value
- *Precision* refers to how close a series of measurements are to one another or how reproducible they are.
![[Pasted image 20240830101615.png]]

Measurements are:
- precise if they are consistent with one another
- accurate only if they are close to the actual value

Scientific measurements are reported so that every digit is certain with the exception of the last digit, which is estimated.

*Random Error* has equal probability of being too high or too low.
*Systematic error* tends toward being either too high or too low.

![[Pasted image 20240830103745.png]]

Most chem problems will be unit conversion problems.
Dimensional analysis is the fractional unit conversion idea.

Units should always be included in calculations; they are multiplied, divided, and canceled like any other algebraic quantity.

*The Logarithm of a number should have as many decimal places as the number significant figures in the number*

For example using base 10 logarithms, the **log** of $22.5$ ($3$ significant figures) should be reported as $1.352$ ($3$ decimal places).

![[Pasted image 20240830104540.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240830104552.png]]

Example conversion problem:
$$\frac{9255\ cm^3}{1} \times \frac{1\ mL}{1\ cm^3} \times \frac{1\ L}{1000\ mL} \times \frac{1\ gal}{3.7854\ L} = 2.4449...=2.445\ gal$$

**Mole**

A **mole** (mol) of anything contains $6.02214\times 10^{23}$ items.
- This is generally used with atoms but it could be any item.

The mole is known as **Avogadro's Number**. The value of the mole is equal to the number of atoms in exactly $12$ grams of pure C-12

# Chapter $2$: The Atom
An atom is composed of a nucleus and an electron cloud.

- Nucleus is a dense center composed of protons with a + charge and neutrons
- Electrons are negatively charged and take up the vast majority of the space of the atom. 

The mass of a proton is 1.672622 x e-24g
The mass of a neutron is 1.674927 e-24g
The mass of an electron is 9.109384 e-28g

amu (or u) is the atomic mass unit.  The most important number to the identitz of an atom is the number of protons. This is known as the *atomic number* (Z)

Isotopes are elements with a varied number of protons but different number of neutrons. 

Example a neon atom with 10, 11, and 12 neutrons respectivelz.

$$^{20}_{10}Ne\ \ \ ^{21}_{10}Ne\ \ \ ^{22}_{10}Ne$$
$A$ = mass number
$Z$ = atomic number
$X$ = Chemical symbol

$$^A_ZX$$
Another way of representing the isotope would be to write:

$X$ = Chemical symbol
$A$ = Mass Number
$$X-A$$
B) 52 - 24 = 28 neutrons and 24 protons in the Cr atom.
C) $^{13}_7C$
D) 39 - 19 = 20 neutrons and 19 protons in the Potassium isotope.

Positively charged ions are called **cations**
Negatively charged ions are called **anions**

**Mass spectrometry** is a technique that separates particles according to their mass.

![[Pasted image 20240909100931.png]]

**Metallic Character** is how closely an element's properties match the ideal properties of a metal.

Metallic character decreases left to right and increases down the column.

![[Pasted image 20240909101424.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240909101703.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240909101727.png]]

When non-metal combine, they form molecules.

We need to specify the number of each atom by way of a prefix.

| 1   | mono-  | 6   | hexa-  |
| --- | ------ | --- | ------ |
| 2   | di-    | 7   | hepta- |
| 3   | tri-   | 8   | octa-  |
| 4   | tetra- | 9   | nona-  |
| 5   | penta- | 10  | deca-  |

![[Pasted image 20240909102207.png]]

**Ionic compounds** are composed of cations (metals) and anions (nonmentals) bound together by electrostatic attraction.

*The basic unit of an ionic compound is the **formula unit**, the smallest, electrically neutral collection of ions*.

**Ionic Compound Formulas**
- Ionic compounds always contain positive and negative ions
- The sum of the charges of the positive ions must equal the sum of the charges of the negative ions.
- The formula of ionic compounds reflects the smallest whole-number ratio of ions.
