# **Chapter 1:**

Have a physical notebook to work out the problems in chem. 

**Chemistry** $\rightarrow$ The study of matter.

**Matter** $\rightarrow$ Any that occupies space and has mass

**Mass** $\rightarrow$ Measure of the amount of matter that an object contains

> All know substances in our universe are composed of 94 naturally occurring atoms.

**Atom** $\rightarrow$ Smallest distinguishable particle (for this class at least)

Scientific Method:
1. Make an observation
2. Form a hypothesis
	1. A good hypothesis is *falsifiable*
	2. The results of an experiment may support a hypothesis or prove it wrong
3. Conduct experiments

**Law** $\rightarrow$ A concise verbal o mathematical statement that describes an observable occurrence that is always true under any conditions.

Laws allow use to predict future observations.

**Theory** $\rightarrow$ A well-tested, unifying principle that explains a body of facts.
- Theories can suggest new hypotheses that can be tested experimentally.

Classifications of Matter:
- State (solid, liquid, gas, plasma)
	-  In *solid matter* the atoms or molecules pack close to each other. It has a fixed volume and a fixed shape.
	- In *liquid matter* the molecules pack about as closely as the do in solid matter but they are free to more relative to each other (fixed volume, not fixed shape)
	- In *gaseous matter* they have an infinite shape and volume.
- Composition (element, compound, mixture)
	- Pure substance or a mixture
	- Pure substances can't be broken down in normal circumstances.
	- Compounds are substances composed of two or more elements in fixed definite proportions. A compound can be broken down into its' components. 

Inter-molecular forces help us understand these classifications. 

Familiarize yourself with the periodic table!

**Temperature Conversions**

$$K = \degree C \ + \ 273.15$$
$$\degree C = \frac{(\degree F - 32)}{1.8}$$
$$\degree F = (1.8)\degree C + 32$$
**Mass Length and Volume**

Remember:
- $1kg = 1000g$
- $1g  = 1000mg$

$1\ cm^3 = 1\ ml = 0.001\ L$

**Energy Units**
![[Pasted image 20240830101418.png]]

**Reliability of Measurements**
- *Accuracy* refers to how close the measured value is to the actual value
- *Precision* refers to how close a series of measurements are to one another or how reproducible they are.
![[Pasted image 20240830101615.png]]

Measurements are:
- precise if they are consistent with one another
- accurate only if they are close to the actual value

Scientific measurements are reported so that every digit is certain with the exception of the last digit, which is estimated.

*Random Error* has equal probability of being too high or too low.
*Systematic error* tends toward being either too high or too low.

![[Pasted image 20240830103709.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240830103745.png]]

Most chem problems will be unit conversion problems.
Dimensional analysis is the fractional unit conversion idea.

Units should always be included in calculations; they are multiplied, divided, and canceled like any other algebraic quantity.

*The Logarithm of a number should have as many decimal places as the number significant figures in the number*

For example using base 10 logarithms, the **log** of $22.5$ ($3$ significant figures) should be reported as $1.352$ ($3$ decimal places).

![[Pasted image 20240830104540.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240830104552.png]]

Example conversion problem:
$$\frac{9255\ cm^3}{1} \times \frac{1\ mL}{1\ cm^3} \times \frac{1\ L}{1000\ mL} \times \frac{1\ gal}{3.7854\ L} = 2.4449...=2.445\ gal$$

**Mole**

A **mole** (mol) of anything contains $6.02214\times 10^{23}$ items.
- This is generally used with atoms but it could be any item.

The mole is known as **Avogadro's Number**. The value of the mole is equal to the number of atoms in exactly $12$ grams of pure C-12

![[Pasted image 20240904102217.png]]

# Chapter $2$: The Atom
An atom is composed of a nucleus and an electron cloud.

- Nucleus is a dense center composed of protons with a + charge and neutrons
- Electrons are negatively charged and take up the vast majority of the space of the atom. 

The mass of a proton is 1.672622 x e-24g
The mass of a neutron is 1.674927 e-24g
The mass of an electron is 9.109384 e-28g

amu (or u) is the atomic mass unit.  The most important number to the identitz of an atom is the number of protons. This is known as the *atomic number* (Z)

Isotopes are elements with a varied number of protons but different number of neutrons. 

Example a neon atom with 10, 11, and 12 neutrons respectivelz.

$$^{20}_{10}Ne\ \ \ ^{21}_{10}Ne\ \ \ ^{22}_{10}Ne$$
$A$ = mass number
$Z$ = atomic number
$X$ = Chemical symbol

$$^A_ZX$$
Another way of representing the isotope would be to write:

$X$ = Chemical symbol
$A$ = Mass Number
$$X-A$$
B) 52 - 24 = 28 neutrons and 24 protons in the Cr atom.
C) $^{13}_7C$
D) 39 - 19 = 20 neutrons and 19 protons in the Potassium isotope.

Positively charged ions are called **cations**
Negatively charged ions are called **anions**

**Mass spectrometry** is a technique that separates particles according to their mass.

![[Pasted image 20240909100931.png]]

**Metallic Character** is how closely an element's properties match the ideal properties of a metal.

Metallic character decreases left to right and increases down the column.

![[Pasted image 20240909101424.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240909101703.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240909101727.png]]

When non-metal combine, they form molecules.

We need to specify the number of each atom by way of a prefix.

| 1   | mono-  | 6   | hexa-  |
| --- | ------ | --- | ------ |
| 2   | di-    | 7   | hepta- |
| 3   | tri-   | 8   | octa-  |
| 4   | tetra- | 9   | nona-  |
| 5   | penta- | 10  | deca-  |

![[Pasted image 20240909102117.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240909102207.png]]

**Ionic compounds** are composed of cations (metals) and anions (nonmentals) bound together by electrostatic attraction.

*The basic unit of an ionic compound is the **formula unit**, the smallest, electrically neutral collection of ions*.

**Ionic Compound Formulas**
- Ionic compounds always contain positive and negative ions
- The sum of the charges of the positive ions must equal the sum of the charges of the negative ions.
- The formula of ionic compounds reflects the smallest whole-number ratio of ions.

Anytime you see $O_2$, that Oxygen is acting as an oxidant. Often acting in a combustion reaction.

Idk man, just look over the slides before taking the test. Also make sure to add your paper notes here.

# Chapter 4: Stoichiometry (?)

*Reaction stoichiometry is the relationship between the amounts of chemicals (in moles).*  This allows us to predict the amounts of product that will form based on the amount of reacting set we have.

The coefficients in the chemical reaction specify these relative amounts in moles.

For example:
$$2C_8H_{18}\ +\ 25O_2\rightarrow 16CO_2\ +\ 18H_2O$$

From the balanced chemical equations, you can make the following ratios:
$\frac{2\ mol\ C_8H_{18}}{25\ mol\ O_2}$, $\frac{16\ mol\ CO_2}{18\ mol\ H_2O}$, $\frac{2\ mol\ C_8H_{18}}{18\ mol\ H_2O}$, etc.

The rations can be used to solve problems such as:
> *If  $22\ mol\ C_8H_{18}$ are burned, how many moles of $CO_2$ are formed?*
 $$22\ mol\ C_8H_{18}\ \times\ \frac{16\ mol\ CO_2}{2\ mol\ C_8H_{18}}\ =\ 176\ mol\ CO_2 $$

**Limiting Reactants**
Example: A diner is offering a breakfast special. Each special is $2$ eggs, $2$ pieces of bacon, and $1$ biscuit. If the diner has $12$ eggs, $14$ pieces of bacon, and $7$ biscuits, how many specials can the diner sell? 

Thus the limiting reactant is the:
- Reaction that limits the amount of product that can be made
- Reaction that results in the smallest amount of product
- Other reactions are consider in excess

# Chapter 5
*Energy* - anything that has the capacity to do work
*Work* - Work is a force acting over a distance
- $Work = force\ \times\  distance$
*Heat* - the flow of energy caused by a difference in temperature

**Heat** and **work** are the two different ways an object can exchange energy with other objects.

*System* - the material or process within which we are studying the energy changes within.
*Surroundings* - everything else with which the system can exchange energy.
*Thermodynamics* - the study of energy that is exchanged between the system and the surroundings.

For $q$ heat:
**Exothermic:**
$$q_{system} < 0$$
**Endothermic:**
$$q_{system} > 0$$
![[Pasted image 20241007103206.png]]

Change in energy i
For surroundings doing work on the system. Pressure ($P$) is changing with Volume ($V$), in this case work is negative. Then if the system is doing work on the system. Then $V$ will be negative, thus work ($w$) will be positive.  

$$\Delta E=q + w$$
$$w = -P \Delta V$$
($q$) is energy. Normally measured in Joules.

**Boyle's Law**:
When $P$ is in `atm` and $V$ is in some unit volume
$$P_1V_1 = P_2V_2$$ 
**Charles' Law**:
When $V$ is in some unit volume and $T$ is in `K`
$$\frac{V_1}{T_1} = \frac{V_2}{T_2}$$

Try to attend all the sections for the ACS review as possible.
Final exam: Dec 13th. 70 Question, 2hrs. Less than 2 mins per question.

In general, the more electrons two atoms share, the stronger the covalent bond.
In general, the shorter the covalent bond, the stronger the bond.

Bond breaking is endothermic and bond making is exothermic.

Electron groups around the central atom will be most stable when they are as far apart as possible, this is the basis for VSEPR Theory.  Because electrons are negatively charged. 

An *Electron Group* could be referring to any type of bond, or a lone pair.

Relative sizes of repulsive force interaction are as follows:
Lone pair to Lone Pair > Lone pair to Bonding Pair > Bonding Pair to Bonding Pair

Lone pairs generally go into equatorial positions.

Using VSERP To Predict Molecular Geometries
1. Draw the Lewis Structure
2. Determint the number of electron groups around the central atom
3. Classifiy each electron group as bonding or lone pair and count each type
4. Determine the shape and bond angles or apporximate bond angles
