**Professor**: Dr. Jurss

Attendance: 
Very light. You can miss up to eight classes before getting any direct consequences. After each after your grade is reduced by a letter grade.
You have until 10:10 am before the attendance scanners count you as absent.

Textbook material should be available as an ebook. Online homework is also online.

OWLV2 is our homework system. (kinda like Person from Calc ig)

4, 1 hour exams. Frequent exams is common in Chem. These exams are about every 3/4 weeks. **Don't fall behind here**. 

Final exam on top (so fifth): Final exam will replace your lowest grade in the class. Just like Comp Sci. 

Review Sessions: 

Abby:
Mon 4-5:30p Lamar 129
Wed - 4:45 - 6:15p Bishop 107

Trey:
T, TH 5:30 - 7:00p Bishop 107

General Chem help desk: DUFF 404 M - TH 9a - 4p

Office Hours : M 2p - 3p, W 3:30p - 4:30p

Really  look at the ebook and online homework system. Lots of stuff in there.

Scantrons: 
We use scantrons during the test. We need the purple Scan trons. If you bring 5 scan trons to a test, you get bonus points.

Every question on the homework as 10 attempts. Homework is 20% of your grade so ace this. 

We may need the TI-84 for this class.

(says computer isn't allowed in the sylabus may need a physical notebook)

Diferent types of information:
a) Factual Information (What)
	- Periodic table/trends
	- Nomenclature
	- Definition of phenomena
b) Procedural Information (How)
	- Chem 115 lab
	- Data processing
c) Conceptual Information (Why)
- Data interpretation

Grade:
19% homework
59% exams (~%15/exam)
22% final

85 - 100% | 574 - 675 points | A 
70 - 84% | 473 - 573 points | B
55 - 69 % | 371 - 572 points | C

You get 2 hours for the final exam. It is cumlitave for the entire course.

Every odd number question has an answer in the textbook. Lots of practice in OWL. 


# **Chapter 1:**

Have a physical notebook to work out the problems in chem. 

**Chemistry** $\rightarrow$ The study of matter.

**Matter** $\rightarrow$ Any that occupies space and has mass

**Mass** $\rightarrow$ Measure of the amount of matter that an object contains

> All know substances in our universe are composed of 94 naturally occurring atoms.

**Atom** $\rightarrow$ Smallest distinguishable particle (for this class at least)

Scientific Method:
1. Make an observation
2. Form a hypothesis
	1. A good hypothesis is *falsifiable*
	2. The results of an experiment may support a hypothesis or prove it wrong
3. Conduct experiments

**Law** $\rightarrow$ A concise verbal o mathematical statement that describes an observable occurrence that is always true under any conditions.

Laws allow use to predict future observations.

**Theory** $\rightarrow$ A well-tested, unifying principle that explains a body of facts.
- Theories can suggest new hypotheses that can be tested experimentally.

Classifications of Matter:
- State (solid, liquid, gas, plasma)
	-  In *solid matter* the atoms or molecules pack close to each other. It has a fixed volume and a fixed shape.
	- In *liquid matter* the molecules pack about as closely as the do in solid matter but they are free to more relative to each other (fixed volume, not fixed shape)
	- In *gaseous matter* they have an infinite shape and volume.
- Composition (element, compound, mixture)
	- Pure substance or a mixture
	- Pure substances can't be broken down in normal circumstances.
	- Compounds are substances composed of two or more elements in fixed definite proportions. A compound can be broken down into its' components. 

Inter-molecular forces help us understand these classifications. 

Familiarize yourself with the periodic table!
