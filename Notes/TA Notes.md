Make sure to get sign in sheet out. Make you physical hand each student the sign in sheet. This is to stop their friends for signing for them.

To get credit: You must submit the .java file **AND** sign the sign-in sheet.

We can delete accidental submissions. 
Make sure students let us know when they have to leave the LAB. 
Copying work isn't allowed nor ChatGPT. Students get NO credit for LABs if they are found cheating. You need to monitor and help students!

Grading is done *after* the lab. No deducting points for receiving help, just make sure you **don't tell them what to type**.\

For programs you will only be clarfing questions about the lab. Do not tell them what to type or answer coding questions. They can use notes. They cannot talk with one another. Grading is the same.
