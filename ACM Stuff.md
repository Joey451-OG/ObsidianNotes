## Cross Club Meeting : 2024-09-25

The idea is to get ACM and Coding Club to *sponsor* the Hackathon. We need to contact the ASB to see if this idea is even possible. 

Hackathon will be having a meeting soon.

Things to do: 
- Plan a meeting with ASB treasury

Claudia spoke to Dr. Walter, we need to have more concrete roles for each exec position since she is doing way too much on her own.

The **President**'s (Claudia) main task will be to delegate tasks and manage the operations of the group.

The **Vice President**'s (Kien) role is a bit tricky to define. Some ideas that were brought up are that of: 1) Being a floater by filling in for other exec members where needed, and 2) Being a representative for the Club by handling communications with potential guests, or in other aspects were we need a contact with somebody outside the club.

The **Secretary**'s (Joey) role is to manage the Discord server, setup and take down for club meetings, finding a location for a club meeting when needed, and note taking.

The **Treasurer**'s (Lydia) main role is to manage the club's finances. This mainly entails requesting funding from the ASB. However, there are some tasks that need to be completed soon, notably figuring out our Tax Exempt status, and looking into opening a bank account (if needed) for the club.

The **Public Relations Chair** (Tayla) role is to set up events on the ForUM, manage the Instagram, make posters for the club, and eventually take over managing the Discord.

We need to have a meeting with Dr. Walter about Tax Exception, and the Hackathon funding idea (alongside the ASB Treasurer).

**From the AI Talk**
A brief history of AI
(to be honest, there he goes on the prestige stuff again :-:)

**1950s - 60s**
The perception was invented by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957. It was a single layer neural network. It could learn from data and was capable of binary classification. Researchers and the media touted it as a step towards human-level intelligence. (Maybe the start of AGI talks irl?)

**AI Winter**
A paper was publish that highlighted that the single layer nerual network could not solve non-linear problems. So the multi-layer peception was thought up. However, technology was still behind, thus the research into AI was halted for a while.

**1980s - Expert Systems**
Expert Systems aimed to mimic the decision making abilities of human experts using rules-based behavior trees. However, the computing power began to catch up and these Expert Systems started to be researched more.

**The 2nd AI winter**
This started because of three main issues:
- Knowledge Acqusition Bottleneck
- Scalability Issues
- High Maintenance Costs
